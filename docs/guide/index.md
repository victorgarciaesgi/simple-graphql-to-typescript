# Introduction

## Motive

I work a lot with GraphQL apis and typescript, and since now I was always writing by hand all my interfaces/enums and input types.
I search many solutions for generating them for me (Apollo codegen, graphql-to-typescript ..etc ) but it was never the result I expected. I just wanted a single file with all my types in it, without complexity.

## Is it production ready?

I work in an agency and this library is used in production by all our devs and for many clients, so you can use this for production! ðŸ˜„
